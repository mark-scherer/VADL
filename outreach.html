                <h2><strong>Encouraging STEM Interest</strong></h2>
                <p>One of the main agendas of the VADL is to encourage stem interest and participation among elementary and middle school students, as well as introduce the novel work that we do. Members of the senior design team, as well as underclassmen field engineers participate in frequent community outreach events such as school and science program visits. The outreach team is even planning to present at an educational child-focused science adventure center! The team does not only cater to young students; however, they are also planning on bringing in guest speakers for the larger Vanderbilt population to learn more about the final frontier.</p>

                <p>We discussed the recent push to impement resusable rockets in the aerospace industry. To put the problem in perspective, we explained that with the current practice involving resuing very few parts of the rocket without extensive processing, the cost has escalated to nearly $10,000/lb sent into space on modern rockets. Emphasizing that economic feasibilty is a big part of engineering, we likened the idea of designing a rocket that could be fully reusable, requiring only refueling to prepare for a subsequent mission. After the students hadd the chance to present their solutions to the problem, we showed the latest advancements in this niche of aerospace technology including the recent successful landings of reusable rockets in Cape Canaveral. By discussing the nature of the problem behind reusable rockets, we gave students a good basis to start thinking about how to combat it – and helping them understand why seemingly simple solutions like parachutes aren’t feasible. </p>

                <p>Our visit to Bellevue Middle School to teach Newton’s laws and the fundamentals principles ofrocket flight to the 5th graders was an overwhelming success. Mrs. Deasey was very impressed with the enthusiasm and passion we brought to the event. It was incredibly rewarding to pass along our passion in the field of aerospace engineering to the next generation. One student after another came up to us and thanked us for coming. Many students stayed after class to ask more questions about space, college, and rockets. We found our way into different topics ranging from the Mars Orion mission to our plans for next year’s rocket. Many students expressed interest in going to Vanderbilt and joining our team someday. We really enjoyed getting the chance to inspire these kids to pursue engineering. It was humbling to know that we may have been the spark that ignites a whole lifetime of innovation for some of these children. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis we performed on the pre and post assessments proved our effectiveness as a team in informing the students about a topic for which they had no exposure. As always, we consider any day a success when we have the opportunity to instill in others the same passion for STEM that we have fostered in ourselves. </p>

                <p>The 6th graders of Bellevue Middle School responded very positively to the outreach event as a whole. Mrs. Dulaney was very appreciative of our team and was very impressed with our ability to engage with the students on a level that made learning more or an adventure than a classroom experience. We could have spent all day answering questions after our presentation, as the students brought up one thing after another in our Q/A session. From these questions, we got into discussions on everything from previous year’s payloads to how a planet is affected by the gravity between it and every other planet in the solar system. If it had not been obvious before, our presentation really brought out the best in these students and showed us how much promise the future holds given their exuberant enthusiasm for space, rockets, and science. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis we performed on the pre and post assessments proved our effectiveness as a team in informing the students about a topic for which they had no exposure. Most importantly, however, it was shown that we were able to inspire these students to pursue their love for science as we saw interest in STEM surge after spending a day with them teaching them about what we love, rocketry and engineering. </p>

                <h3><strong>December 3rd and 4th, 2015 - John Early Middle School</strong></h3>
                <p>On Thursday, December 3rd and Friday, December 4th, members of the Vanderbilt Aerospace Design Laboratory visited John Early Museum Magnet Middle School in north Nashville to present to 5th-8th graders about the VADL and what we're doing to build a rocket for NASA SL, communicate to students what engineering is, what engineers do, and how engineers problem solve, and teach lessons about the Newtonian forces of weight, thrust, and drag.  Details concerning our two days at John Early can be found in the report attached.</p>
<p>Our outreach at John Early Middle was particularly meaningful due to the demographics of the student body: John Early's students largely come from underprivileged backgrounds, with 90% on free or reduced lunch.  John Early is a severely underserved academic community, and the school's performance as a whole is barely satisfactory, falling below the 30th percentile in the Academic Performance Framework (source: http://nashvilleschoolfinder.org/school/john-early-middle-prep/).  As expected, it was obvious that the students' exposure to advanced science concepts and to engineering was minimal.  On a positive note, this allowed us to make a huge impact on these students during our brief time with them, as can be seen in the dramatic differences between our pre- and post-assessment metrics.</p>

                <p>On Thursday, November 5th, VADL sponsored a talk by Les Johnson, Senior Technical Advisor for NASA’s Concepts Office (Marshall Space Flight Center) and Vanderbilt alumnus. Mr. Johnson spoke on the topic of Solar Sails for Spacecraft Propulsion, as part of the ongoing Vanderbilt EECS Lecture Series. Thematically, this seminar comes on the heels of our recent outreach event to Whites Creek Renewable Energy Academy discussing Space-Based Solar Energy Generation and Transmission to Earth. Suddenly, Space and Solar Energy have become friends in our pursuit of novel outreach activities this year!  The seminar event was very well attended, with 138 total attendees and 16 faculty members. We used our twitter feed to send the word out to engineering students and the participation was extraordinary; it made Les Johnson happy too!</p>

                <h3><strong>November 4, 2015 - Whites Creek High School Renewable Energy Academy</strong></h3>
                <p>A group of VADL team members planned an educational outreach event for students at Whites Creek High School to discuss space applications of renewable energy sources, specifically solar energy. This presentation had to do specifically with harnessing solar power in space and transmitting energy back Earth for use. The event reached 70+ participants, including teachers and administrators from Whites Creek. Subsequently, the high school students were given time to talk with the VADL team members about their college experience: academics, research, social, and what it means to be a STEM student. Additionally, the team members were able to talk about the fascinating work they are doing this year in relation to the need for slosh-abatement techniques, sustainability, and redundant safety measures.</p>

                <h3><strong>October 13, 2015 - Percy Priest Elementary School</strong></h3>
                <p>A group of 6 members of the VADL visited Percy Priest Elementary School to teach their "Encore Scholars" about space exploration, perform aerospace-related science experiments, and discuss the engineering design process and how we incorporate it into our work. The event reached nearly 60 students ranging from 2nd-4th graders. The session began with the VADL getting to know the students, explaining who we are and what we do, and diving into the field of engineering. VADL members proceeded to answer questions on the fly, and finally discuss principles of aerospace design (specifically with the older students). The team covered specific topics related to forces, lift, drag, and engineering tradeoffs necessary to make a rocket fly.</p>
                <p>The team broke from presentations to perform a fan-cart based activity with the students. The students were broken into groups of 4-6 each and given worksheets to complete relating to forces acting on a "frictionless" fan-cart. After this activity, the class reconveniened for a discussion on how the fan-cart activity relates to aerospace, and how the carts can be redesigned, a normal engineering process. Finally, the VADL took the students outside for a bottle-rocket demonstration to demonstrate how pressure (providing thrust), and weight (gravity) affect the flight of even the smallest sub-scale rockets.</p>
